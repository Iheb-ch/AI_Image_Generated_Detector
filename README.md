# AI Image Generated Detector
Detect Images generated by AI (stableDiffusion ...)<br />
I made a basic UI with gradio and deployed it in HuggingFace Spaces.You can try it through this [link](https://huggingface.co/spaces/ReacherTN/ai_image_gen_detector).
## Model
I fine-tuned a binary classifier (efficientnetv2_b0 as a backbone) on a 20k images dataset in a 5-fold cross-validation.
It achieves the following results :<br />
<li>Loss : 0.09 </li><br />
<li>F1 score : 0.97 </li><br />

## Training procedure
